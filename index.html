<h1>Cats</h1>
<p>Dogs are good as well but cats don't get enough appreciation in this class because you are all mean. This is the last cat thing I do because you have broken my spirits but first I shall show you you why cats are amazing and you are all just dumb.</p>

<p> Here's a cat to look at while I quickly talk about how much I at while I quickly talk about how much I hate you all. To not waste my time I will just say, you are all the meanest people I have ever had in my class. Most of you can't even face the fact that you are rude and unkind in the first place, you all just so mean and just annoying in general.

<p> But I will forgive you since some of you are decent. <p>
